This tutorial describes how to make a palette. To begin with, check out the
[default palette I made](https://github.com/Kolyn090/real-ascii/blob/main/resource/palette_files/palette_default_consolab_fast.json) first.

```json
{
  "name": "palette_default_consolab_fast",
  "templates": [
    {
      "layer": 0,
      "chars": " ",
      "font": "C:/Windows/Fonts/consolab.ttf",
      "font_size": 24,
      "char_bound_width": 13,
      "char_bound_height": 22,
      "match_method": "fast"
    },
    {
      "omitted": "the rest of contents have been omitted..."
    }
  ]
}
```

All templates should begin with a dictionary that has a property `name` and a property `templates`.

`name` is not functionally used in code, so technically you can name it anything you want. 

`templates` is more important. It's a list of dictionaries and each dictionary in it is
called a `layer`.

## Object in templates

It's there for you as a memo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**override_widths**

A list of the following objects. When set, use the overridden bound width rather than
`char_bound_width` for the specified character. Width must be greater than 0.
```txt
{
  "char": (char),
  "width": (int)
}
```

<br>


**override_weights**
A list of the following objects. When set, use the overridden weight rather than the one calculated by
the program for the specified character. Weight can be any number. 

:::tip
Tip: if you want some
characters to appear less frequently in the final result, such as white space, you can set its weight
to a big negative number (such as -10000).

```txt
{
  "char": (char),
  "weight": (float)

More layers will lead the algorithm to be more precise about the shading levels.
In theory, this will output better quality rendering if you do things correctly.
Usually for the layers in the higher rank you should use less dense characters. For example:
```txt
. , '
```
For the layers in the lower rank you should use more dense characters. For example:
```txt
% # @
```
The characters are not limited to ASCII characters. You can use other characters as long as 
your font supports them.
