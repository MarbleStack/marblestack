This tutorial will teach you how to utilize the Switch Control feature in iOS Accessibility to automate battles in The Battle Cats. **Disclaimer: Use at your own risk! I won't be responsible for any damage caused by following this tutorial.** Please read carefully if you intend to use this approach and ensure the maximum safety.

In this article, I have included details that are not explained in the video but might help you adapt this approach to other stages.

## Requirements
# Hardware Requirements: 
1. You must have an iOS device with Switch Control feature available.
2. Ensure Custom Gesture is available: Settings -> Accessibility -> Switch Control -> Recipes -> Create New Recipe... -> Assign a Switch... -> Full Screen -> Custom Gesture (Actions)
3. You can play The Battle Cats normally on this device.

# Units Requirements:
This method can be applied to many farming stages. In this tutorial, I have chosen the Cosmic Xmas stage of the **'Christmas in Space'** as an example. That being said, this stage is a little difficult to farm, so the requirements are quite high here but it won't be as picky if you are farming some material stages. You will have to design and attempt some trial-and-errors to get things right.

For Christmas in Space, my lineup is:

First line:
- Hayabusa
- Flying Ninja Cat
- Richest Cat
- Li'l Dark Cat
- Neo Cutter Cat (52)

Second line: 
- King of Extinction Phono (60)
- Cancan Cat (63)
- Bullet Train Cat (50)

The units not marked with level will not be deployed.
The Combos give Speed Up II, Starting money II, Starting wallet I, Attack Power I.

When choosing attacking units, prefer fast-moving, high-attacking-power units: Manic Lion Cat, Bullet Train Cat, Cancan Cat, Yukimura, Bahamut...

Sometimes you might want to bring long-range units to clear out the path, such as Courier Cat, Phono/Phonoa...

<br>
<br>
### How to know if a stage can be farmed using this approach?
Generally, the battle should be completed **within 40 seconds** because <u>the longest time in Custom Gesture is a minute</u> and you will need around 20 seconds for stuffs for automation. That's why Speed Up II combo is important as it shortens the battle time, but you can take it out if your are confident that it will be below 40 seconds. 

Also, the maximum number of units you can deploy per battle is **four** (3 if you use Cat Cannon). That's because of the Custom Gesture will only allow 10 clicks and 6 of them are already taken by automation process not matter what stage you are farming. (What 6, You wonder? Check out the video [4:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwu47d9wgiE&t=4m50s), [5:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwu47d9wgiE&t=5m41s))

Here is a list of good stages where you can farm materials:
- Gold/Meteorite: Beyond the Savannah - Dry Season (Cancan, Bahamut)
- Bones: Walk of Fame - Paparazzi Paradise (Bahamut)
- Sprockets: The Legend Begins - Earthshaker (Manic Lion)
