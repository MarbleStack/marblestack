This blog contains a poster about a parody game I have made years ago for a game called 'The Escapists'. Due to the lack of attention (I messaged to both the game dev and the publishers but gotten no reply), I have paused updating this game. If you think this project has potential and want to work on it with me, you can email me at `kolynlin@protonmail.com` to reach out. I might consider reopen the project if someone think it's worthy.
